   Monthly mean-sea-level pressure anomalies (w.r.t. 1926-35) from the 20CRv3 ensemble. The vertical axis is latitude, and each pixel is a longitudinal mean from a randomly selected ensemble member. 

Sampling in this way means that regions where the variance across the ensemble is large appear speckled. This provides an indication of uncertainty.
