Download the EUSTACE1.0 dataset
===============================

The EUSTACE dataset is available from CEDA (`link <http://data.ceda.ac.uk/neodc/eustace/data/combined/mohc/eustace/v1.0/day/0/0/R001400/20190326/global/>`_). It is a large dataset (1.7Tb), but it's distributed as one file per day so it's straightforward to get just the data for a selected period:
