   Monthly 2m-temperature anomalies (w.r.t. 1926-35) from the scout 4.6.1 ensemble (top), the 20CRv3 ensemble (middle), nd the difference between the two (bottom). The vertical axis is latitude, and each pixel is a longitudinal mean from a randomly selected ensemble member. 

Sampling in this way means that regions where the variance across the ensemble is large appear speckled. This provides an indication of uncertainty.
