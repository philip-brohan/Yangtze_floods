The Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) reconstructs the weather of the past 200 years using boundary condition datasets of SST and sea-ice and assimilating observations of surface pressure. Assimilating only surface pressure observations has not only allowed the reconstruction of atmospheric states well back into the past, it also allows the reanalysis system to be used for attribution studies: Because it assimilates surface pressures it can produce a good reconstruction of the atmospheric states associated with interesting or extreme weather events; because it assimilates *only* surface pressures, temperature and precipitation in those reconstructions are still free to respond to changes in boundary conditions. So we can investigate the effect of a change in SST, for example, on a particular extreme event.
We are applying this method to the 1931 China floods. The first step is to make the best possible reanalysis over China, for 1931. So we have collaborated, with CMA and the International ACRE initiative, to digitise additional historical pressure observations for 41 weather stations in and around China, and re-run the reanalysis assimilating those observations. Additional data rescue work has provided new observations from weather stations in India and South-East Asia, and U.S. gunboats patrolling the Yangtze - these observations have not been assimilated, but will be used for validation. Work setting-up and running the reanalysis with perturbed SSTs is ongoing.
